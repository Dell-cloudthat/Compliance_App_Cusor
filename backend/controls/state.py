Effective control state — Phase 2.1

The ONLY function that decides what status a control has for scoring, the
Trust Passport, and MSP dashboards.  Nobody can set a control to "pass" by
writing a status directly.

Precedence (highest first) for each control:

  1. Open work on a finding linked to the control
     (open / assigned / in_progress / submitted_for_review / reopened,
      or a risk acceptance that has EXPIRED)            → fail / in_progress
  2. Active risk acceptance on a linked finding         → fail, flagged risk_accepted
     (accepted risk is tracked, never scored as passing)
  3. Approved (closed) finding linked to the control    → pass  (evidence: manual,
                                                            reviewed + approved)
  4. Active attestation covering the control            → pass  (evidence:
                                                            attested_third_party)
  5. Manual status (fail / unknown / in_progress only)  → as written
  6. Nothing                                            → unknown

Manual writes of "pass" or "not_applicable" are rejected at the API layer —
"not_applicable" would silently remove a control from the denominator, which
is the same as passing it.
